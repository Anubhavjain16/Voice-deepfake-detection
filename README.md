# 🎙️ Voice Deepfake Detection App

This is a Streamlit-based web application that detects whether an uploaded audio file is **real** or **fake** (AI-generated/deepfake) using a trained machine learning model.

## 🔍 Project Overview

With the growing risks of voice-based impersonation, this tool provides a simple interface to identify deepfake audio using **MFCC features** and a **pretrained classifier**.

### 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- Librosa
- Scikit-learn / XGBoost
- Numpy
- Pickle

## 📂 Project Structure

```

├── app.py                 # Main Streamlit application
├── best\_model.pkl         # Pretrained ML model for classification
├── uploaded\_audio.wav     # Temporarily stored uploaded audio

````

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The user uploads a `.wav` audio file through the UI.
2. The app extracts **MFCC** features using `librosa`.
3. These features are passed to the trained ML model.
4. The model classifies the sample as `Real` or `Fake`.
5. The result is shown instantly on the UI.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/voice-deepfake-detector.git
cd voice-deepfake-detector
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Sample requirements.txt</strong></summary>

```text
streamlit
librosa
numpy
scikit-learn
soundfile
```

</details>

### 3. Add the Model File

Ensure you have `best_model.pkl` (trained model) placed in the same directory as `app.py`.

> 🧠 You can train your own model using the Fake-or-Real (FoR) dataset or use the provided model.

### 4. Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🧪 Model Details

* **Input:** MFCC mean features extracted from `.wav` files
* **Model:** Trained using classifiers like Random Forest / XGBoost
* **Dataset:** [Fake-or-Real (FoR)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/avipatel/fake-or-real-voice-dataset)
